# hello-world
My first repository.

Hi. I code badly and want to have a place to stockpile all that shitty code in case of a nuclear war so my country has atleast has something to use. All this shit will probably have a yield of gazillion gigatons all piled up in github servers and ready.

## This repository will provide:
- Nothing of use.
- Cluttered code.
- Probably the occasional non-boring stuff.
